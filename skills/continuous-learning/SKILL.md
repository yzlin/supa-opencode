# Continuous Learning Skill

Automatically evaluates OpenCode sessions on end to extract reusable patterns that can be saved as learned skills.

## When to Activate

- Setting up automatic pattern extraction from OpenCode sessions
- Configuring session end evaluation
- Reviewing or curating learned skills in `~/.config/opencode/skills/learned/`
- Adjusting extraction thresholds or pattern categories
- Comparing v1 (this) vs v2 (instinct-based) approaches

## How It Works

This skill runs at the end of each session:

1. **Session Evaluation**: Checks if session has enough messages (default: 10+)
2. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies extractable patterns from the session
3. **Skill Extraction**: Saves useful patterns to `~/.config/opencode/skills/learned/`

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize:

```json
{
  "min_session_length": 10,
  "extraction_threshold": "medium",
  "auto_approve": false,
  "learned_skills_path": "~/.config/opencode/skills/learned/",
  "patterns_to_detect": [
    "error_resolution",
    "user_corrections",
    "workarounds",
    "debugging_techniques",
    "project_specific"
  ],
  "ignore_patterns": [
    "simple_typos",
    "one_time_fixes",
    "external_api_issues"
  ]
}
```

## Pattern Types

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `error_resolution` | How specific errors were resolved |
| `user_corrections` | Patterns from user corrections |
| `workarounds` | Solutions to framework/library quirks |
| `debugging_techniques` | Effective debugging approaches |
| `project_specific` | Project-specific conventions |

## Hook Setup

In OpenCode, session-end evaluation is triggered via the plugin's `session.deleted` or `session.idle` events, which are handled by the bundled `ecc-hooks.ts` plugin. No manual `opencode.json` hook configuration is needed.

If installed manually, the script path is:
`~/.config/opencode/skills/continuous-learning/evaluate-session.sh`

## Why Session End?

- **Lightweight**: Runs once at session end
- **Non-blocking**: Doesn't add latency to every message
- **Complete context**: Has access to full session transcript

## Comparison Notes (Research: Jan 2025)

### vs Homunculus

Homunculus v2 takes a more sophisticated approach:

| Feature | Our Approach | Homunculus v2 |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Observation | Session end hook | `tool.execute.before`/`tool.execute.after` hooks (100% reliable) |
| Analysis | Main context | Background agent (gpt-5.3-codex-spark) |
| Granularity | Full skills | Atomic "instincts" |
| Confidence | None | 0.3-0.9 weighted |
| Evolution | Direct to skill | Instincts → cluster → skill/command/agent |
| Sharing | None | Export/import instincts |

**Key insight from homunculus:**
> "v1 relied on skills to observe. Skills are probabilistic—they fire ~50-80% of the time. v2 uses hooks for observation (100% reliable) and instincts as the atomic unit of learned behavior."

### Potential v2 Enhancements

1. **Instinct-based learning** - Smaller, atomic behaviors with confidence scoring
2. **Background observer** - gpt-5.3-codex-spark agent analyzing in parallel
3. **Confidence decay** - Instincts lose confidence if contradicted
4. **Domain tagging** - code-style, testing, git, debugging, etc.
5. **Evolution path** - Cluster related instincts into skills/commands
